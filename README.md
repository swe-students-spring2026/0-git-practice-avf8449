**[Why Modern Software Still Collapses Under Its Own Complexity](https://medium.com/p/why-modern-software-still-collapses-under-its-own-complexity)** *By Dick Dowdell (Jan 2026)*

## Why I find it interesting:

This article is interesting because it talks about the original vision Alan Kay (the father of Object Oriented Programming) had.  It is surprising that the actual inspiration was biology, based on cells that despites being autonomous and protecting their state, they communicate with others through messages. 

The author of the article later explains *Assertion-driven development* where buisness rules are captured as formal machine readable declarations. Instead of translating requirements into code, the executable software should be generated directly from these assertions. This limits the system to be able to enter an incorrect state.
